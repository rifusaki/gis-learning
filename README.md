# `gis-learning`
This is where I store all of my learning GIS projects. `maps` contains all QGIS or ArcMap projects. The data must be added from [`gis-learning-data`](https://github.com/rifusaki/gis-learning-data) as follows:
1. Install [kart](https://kartproject.org).
2. Clone `gis-learning`
3. `cd gis-learning`
4. Run `kart clone https://github.com/rifusaki/gis-learning-data.git`
